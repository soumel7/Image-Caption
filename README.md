# Image-Caption
My ML model will be predicting a caption for the given image.


I have two datasets: One is for the captions and the second will be for the images.

DATASET DESCRIPTION: The image dataset contains around 8000 images , around 6000 images are used for training , 1000 images for validation and 1000 images for testing.
The caption dataset contains 5 captions for each of the 6000 images that are used for training.
Therefore, there are a total of 30000 captions.


I will be using Functional API Keras model to put all the layers together.
